          <p class="content"> The first thing is to recognise that there is nothing wrong with not being completely sure of yourself. People are pressured by society to always <br> “be sure of yourself” or “be confident”, as if there was a switch we could turn on by choice. So don’t be too hard on yourself for example being <br> socially awkward or not knowing your weaknesses and strengths. Your woes are shared by all.<br><br>

            In general, I would say reflection of oneself with respect to life’s experiences, good or bad, promote growth. Treasure all the experiences life has <br> presented to you.
            
            From experience, I can say the quickest way to finding out more about yourself is to put oneself into situations out of your comfort zone. <br>Take up that job offered in a country you know nothing about, go to that event you so dread, learn a new language etc. Whenever you are put on a spot, <br>the essence of who you are bubbles up to the surface and you get added clarity about your person. Notice how I said this is a good way to go about knowing <br> yourself but it isn’t the only way.<br></p>
